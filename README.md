# End-to-End-Book-Recommendation-System
A recommendation system is a tool that suggests items that a user might be interested in, based on their previous interactions with items in a system. In a recommendation system using scikit-learn, you would first need to gather data on users' interactions with items in the system. This could include information on which items a user has viewed, purchased, or otherwise interacted with.






This project is an end-to-end book recommendation system using collaborative filtering. The system takes in user ratings for books and makes recommendations based on the ratings of similar users.
