# End-to-End-Book-Recommendation-System
A recommendation system is a tool that suggests items that a user might be interested in, based on their previous interactions with items in a system. In a recommendation system using scikit-learn, you would first need to gather data on users' interactions with items in the system. This could include information on which items a user has viewed, purchased, or otherwise interacted with.

To train a collaborative filtering model using scikit-learn, you would first need to prepare your data by transforming it into a matrix where each row represents a user, and each column represents an item. Each cell in the matrix would contain the rating that a user gave to an item, or a null value if the user has not interacted with the item.

Next, you would split your data into a training set and a test set. The training set would be used to train the recommendation model, while the test set would be used to evaluate the performance of the model.





This project is an end-to-end book recommendation system using collaborative filtering. The system takes in user ratings for books and makes recommendations based on the ratings of similar users.
